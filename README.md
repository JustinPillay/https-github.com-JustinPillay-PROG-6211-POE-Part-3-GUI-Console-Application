--FEEDBACK IMPLEMENTATION

From my feedback received, I made some adjustments to the math surrounding the balance and warning that shows when the user has spend over 75% of their [now] net income. The user manual was made with the principle of making the instructions a lot clearer and straightforward as well as providing more information with regards to spec and software. Changelog with changes made from previous version added to readme.
